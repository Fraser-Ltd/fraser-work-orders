**1.0 Application Overview**

Established 127 years ago, Fraser, Ltd. is the longest running non-profit in North Dakota.  To this day they continue their original focus on the needs of both children and adults, but have also expanded their services to include independent living supports, residential services, and more.  This expanded effort means there’s a lot to maintain, and keep track of.  This is where Fraser MMS will come into play.

The Fraser MMS application is a custom-built web-based solution to Fraser, LTD’s ongoing maintenance management system.  This will streamline communication between Resident Coordinators, the Director of Program Operations, and the maintenance staff with a goal to eliminate paperwork, add visibility, and simplify the work order process.
